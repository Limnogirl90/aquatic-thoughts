# Abstract

Present in over 460 marine fish species, bioluminescence is a multifaceted
 phenomenon that is adaptive for species that rely on camouflage to evade
 predators, for species to communicate with each other for mating events,
 as well as for prey and predator detection. Different wavelengths of light
 are present in various species as well as different mechanisms of production
 of bioluminescence within light organs. A review of the literature stresses
 the implications that bioluminescence has evolved more than once in fish and
 that the adaptations perceived in different species serve more than one
 purpose.
