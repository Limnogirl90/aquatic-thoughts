# Introduction

\label{sec:Introduction}
Bioluminescence has been studied on mesopelagic fish in several different
families of fish, from lantern sharks (Etmopteridae) of the Squaliformes to
members of Myctophidae. A plethora of research exists with respect to the
morphology of photophores, the main functional light-producing organ, as well
as luminescent bacterial symbioses that occur in some fish species (Dunlap et
al. 2007). What is particularly fascinating about the fishesâ€™ ability to
produce and emit light at varying wavelengths is the underlying anatomy of the
photophores and photocytes (Turner et al. 2009). In addition to the anatomy
and physiology of luminescent fish, there is another dimension to origin of
bioluminescence; many marine fish harbor luminescent bacteria symbionts within
their light organs while other species produce light via endogenous reactions
(Dunlap et al 2008). The goal of this review is to 1) introduce the importance
of wavelengths in the environment and those produced by luminescing fishes;
 2) discuss the morphology and anatomy of the light organs; 3) review recent
 research dealing with luminescent bacterial symbioses in fish; and 4) review
 the literature dealing with adaptive, evolutionary, and phylogenetic
 significance of bioluminescence.
